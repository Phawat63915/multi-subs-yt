Youtube has videos that provide subtitles (CC, closed captions) in different languages, but will not display more than one simultaneously on itself's web player. Why not display several at the same time? Why not? 

Nothing fancy, this is a browser addon that works! **Watch with two subtitles on. Even more, three, four, five ... Simultaneously.**

**Display as many as you like! Different languages, translated, auto-generated ...**

Useful for leaning foreign languages.

> 💬 Well... It's true that youtube also contains videos of rumours, bias ... Those bad videos show in the recommendation list time and again. Even some videos spreaing rumours are so well-made that misleading lots of people ! And many misled people commenting help rumours to spread
